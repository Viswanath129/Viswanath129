## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Viswanath** — a student, builder, and researcher-in-progress who’s obsessed with **AI, robotics, and next-gen technology**.

I like working at the intersection of **hardware + software + intelligence**. My projects range from **AI voice assistants and resume screening systems** to **edge AI on NPUs, computer vision, EEG signal processing, and space-tech concepts**. I don’t just code for demos—I try to build things that *actually work* in the real world.

I think in systems:

* break problems down to fundamentals
* test assumptions
* design for constraints (compute, latency, cost)
* then scale the idea up

Right now, I’m focused on:

* **AI on edge devices (Snapdragon NPU, Jetson, embedded systems)**
* **Computer vision & signal processing**
* **Applied research projects aimed at global labs & internships**
* **Building products, not just models**

I’m always experimenting, learning fast, and shipping imperfect versions—because progress beats polish.

📌 *If you’re into AI, deep tech, or ambitious engineering problems, you’ll feel at home here.*
